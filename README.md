# Statistics

In this repository I have attempted to put down the main notes from the introductory book by Professor Peter C. Bruce
"Introductory Statistics and Analytics: A Resampling Perspective, First Edition. Peter C. Bruce.Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, 
Inc. Published 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

The goal is to read the book (as a data scientist in the making, without a deep statistical background) and grasp the most important topic relevant to both fields
of data science and statistics. My main goal is to become more and more acquainted with the topics, not in the sense of memorization, but understand them 
trough intuition and practice. Often, in the traditional settings of learning too much technicality is introduced, and perhaps causing some irritation and 
confusion. I believe a gradual and constant progress can definelty aid into the understanding of the beauty of statistics. Henceforth, this is an attempt to 
gradually reach a global and realistic foundation of the field.
